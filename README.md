# machine-learning-projects
A miscellaneous repository containing some of my quick(er) machine learning projects.

List of Projects:

**1. Health Costs Linear Regression Calculator**

This project uses a linear regression model that is boosted by the XG model from sklearn to predict the cost of health care for individuals given certain features and characteristics with a mean absolute error of less than $2000.

**2. Cats vs Dogs Image Classifier**

This project classifies images of cats or dogs using a dense neural network built on the MobileNet V2 model. It can accurately predict images with a 96% accuracy on testing data.

**3. Heart Failure Prediction Classifier**

This model is a binary classifier which predicts whether a particular patient is subject to heart failure by analyzing features about the person including but not limited to their gender, age and resting blood pressure. This model successfully does this with an accuracy of 86%.

**4. Traffic Sign Classifier**

This model uses a convolutional neural network built on the pre-trained ResNet 50 model to classify any of 47 different traffic signs with an accuracy of 99.6%.
