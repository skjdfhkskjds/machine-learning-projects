# machine-learning-projects
A miscellaneous repo containing machine learning projects.

List of Projects:

**1. Health Costs Linear Regression Calculator**

This project uses a linear regression model that is boosted by the XG model from sklearn to predict the cost of health care for individuals given certain features and characteristics with a mean absolute error of less than $2000.

**2. Cats vs Dogs Image Classifier**

This project classifies images of cats or dogs using a dense neural network built on the MobileNet V2 model. It can accurately predict images with a 96% accuracy on testing data.

**3. Heart Failure Prediction Classifier**
